# awesome-pi-agent

Concise, curated resources for extending and integrating the [pi coding agent](https://shittycodingagent.ai)
(Yes, it was tempting to call it `shitty-list`).

> **📢 Recent Change (v0.35.0):** Hooks and custom tools are now unified as **extensions**. See the [migration guide](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md#extensions-migration) if you're upgrading from older versions.

## Primary project
